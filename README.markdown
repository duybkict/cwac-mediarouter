# CWAC-MediaRouter: Going Where Google Declined To Go, For Some Reason...

**NOTE**: This project has been discontinued, as it is no longer practical
to backport the entirety of `mediarouter-v7`.

This project offers a port of the `mediarouter-v7` Android
library project, to work with
native API Level 11+ fragments and the action bar. While `mediarouter-v7`
requires you to use `appcompat-v7` and the fragments backport,
this project eliminates those requirements.

Note that this library was substantially extended in version 0.2.0 to
be a complete cross-port of `mediarouter-v7`. Formerly, it only contained
`MediaRouteActionProvider` and a few related support classes.

## Installation

This project is available as
an artifact for use with Gradle. To use that, add the following
blocks to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/repo.commonsware.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.commonsware.cwac:mediarouter:0.2.+'
}
```

Or, if you cannot use SSL, use `http://repo.commonsware.com` for the repository
URL.

Eclipse users will need to clone this repository, import the `mediarouter/` project
into the Eclipse workspace, then attach that project as an Android library project
to the app (Project > Properties > Android).

If you elect to clone this repo, or download a ZIP of this repo, and use it
as a source-based library project, you will need to add your own copy of the
`android-support-v13.jar` to your copy of `libs/` in the library project, as it
is not supplied.

## Usage

Basically, everywhere you see `android.support.v7.app` or
`android.support.v7.media` classes from `mediarouter-v7`, replace them
with `com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter.app` and
`com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter.media` equivalents.
And, of course, rather than using `appcompat-v7` and `ActionBarActivity`,
or using the fragments backport, you would use the native action bar
and native fragments implementations.

Note that your menu resources and such will need to reference
`com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter.app.MediaRouteActionProvider` rather than
`android.support.v7.app.MediaRouteActionProvider`. Menu resources should also
use the regular `android:actionProviderClass` attribute for specifying this class,
rather than the alternative required by `appcompat` (e.g., `app:actionProviderClass`).

## Upgrading From 0.1.x to 0.2.0

If you were using the 0.1.x implementation of this library, please note
that:

- You will need to change your class references, in menu resources
and imports. Formerly, you would have used `com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter`
as the package for classes like `MediaRouteActionProvider`. Those classes
all moved into the `com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter.app` package, to
better match the rest of `mediarouter-v7`.

- You should remove your dependency on `mediarouter-v7`. This, in turn,
will require you to change your references to all `mediarouter-v7`
classes to their counterparts in this library. For example, 
`import android.support.v7.media.MediaRouter;` becomes
`import com.commonsware.cwac.mediarouter.media.MediaRouter;`

## Dependencies

This project depends upon `support-v13` and `support-annotations` from
the Android Support Pacakge. It does **not** depend upon `mediarouter-v7`
or `appcompat-v7`.

The minimum supported SDK for this library is API Level 14. If you want to support
older devices, you should be using `appcompat-v7` and the fragments backport anyway.

## Version

This is version v0.2.0 of this module, meaning it is a wee bit more than a proof
of concept, but not by all that much.

## Demo

There are two sample projects, `demo/` and `demo-remoteplayback/`, that illustrate
the use of this library. The first one just shows the `MediaRouteActionProvider` and
shows you the route when it changes. The second one demonstrates the currently-flaky
`RemotePlaybackClient` class, for playing back media on a device like a Chromecast.
